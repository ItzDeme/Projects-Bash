 BASH scripts

I recently started working with BASH

Here are a couple projects/scripts of mine to learn

Ping Script
-A script that pings a website/ip address every 3 minutes, for as long as you want.
 great for keeping track of your ping during gaming.
 
Sys-check
-does a check to see how much memory you have, and how much usage. It also shows the uptime.

Organizedir 
-organizes my desktop by putting certain files into certain folders. IE png into Pictures folders.
